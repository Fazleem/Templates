This template:

verify_database_connection: Verifies that the script can connect to the database using the provided connection details.
check_tables_exist: Checks if the specified tables exist in the database to avoid errors during data retrieval.
check_tables_have_data: Ensures that each specified table contains data to prevent processing empty DataFrames.
After verifying the database connection, table existence, and data presence, the script proceeds with the SQL queries and pandas operations as before. This approach ensures that the script operates on a solid foundation, with checks in place to provide early warnings for common issues such as connection problems, missing tables, or empty data sets.
